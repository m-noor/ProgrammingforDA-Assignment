# Programming for Data Analysis - Assignment
## Assignment for the GMIT HDip in Data Analysis Course

### Brief introduction
This repository is concerned with the use of Python `numpy.random` package. It contains the following files:

1. [README.md](README.md) (this file)
1. [anscombe.csv](anscombe.csv) - a comma-separated values (csv) file containing Anscombe's datasets obtained from [here](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/anscombe.csv)
1. [FundamentalsofDA-Assignment.ipynb](FundamentalsofDA-Assignment.ipynb) - a Jupyter Notebook written in Python
1. [FundamentalsofDA-Assignment.pdf](FundamentalsofDA-Assignment.pdf) - PDF version of the Notebook. Note this is for reference only as the notebook is not accurately reproducible through conversion to PDF.
1. [FundamentalsofDA-assignment-instructions.pdf](FundamentalsofDA-assignment-instructions.pdf) - for future reference only

Content of this repository:

1. README.md (this file)
1. xx.ipynb (Jupyter Notebook)
1. xx.pdf (PDF version of the Jupyter Notebook as a version of record and for quick view)
1. xx.html (HTML version, interactivity is retained since Plotly uses JavaScript for rendering anyway).

## Pre-requisites for running the notebook
This notebook relies on the following libraries, so please ensure you have these installed on your machine before running.

1. Numpy
1. Matplotlib
1. Plotly
1. Scipy
1. Sympy


### Requirements
The Python code in the Notebook uses the following Python libraries, so please ensure these are installed prior to running the codes:
1. `pandas`
1. `numpy`
1. `plotly`
1. `scikit-learn` ('sklearn')
